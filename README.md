<br>**Game Concept**
<br>In a prehistoric world, the first monkey to evolve seeks to help its fellow monkeys grow by opening a humble restaurant. Players take on the role of this visionary monkey chef, preparing and serving food to fulfill specific orders. Each dish contributes to the physical development of the monkey customers, helping them evolve. The goal is to run the restaurant successfully, promote healthy eating, and build a reputation that spans from the Stone Age to the modern era.

<br>**Note:**
<br>A short-term project developed in the two weeks leading up to my main capstone project.  
Still in progress and not yet fully completed.
